            <p style="font-size: large;"><b>My name is Asulkhan Aidarkhanov, i am a BDA student at Astana IT University</b></p>
            I'm passionate about coding. While studying i learned how to work with C++, PostgreSQL and Java.
            <br>
            I also got to apply my knowledge and skills for couple of projects about real-world problems.
            <br>
            On this site you will find my projects, for example the Podcast System database i made while learning PostgreSQL.
            <br>
            I also took part in making an Airline Ticket System utilizing both PostgreSQL database and Java.
            <br>
            While not studying or working on projects, i'm trying my best at making mods to games i like, figuring out C# and Unity while i'm at it.
            <br>
            I'm planning on learning Lua and JSON to use in the future projects.

                    <b>Podcast System</b>
                    <p>A podcast system i made while studying database management systems</p>
                    A PostgreSQL database for storing and manipulating data about podcasts, hosts and users
                    <br>
                    This project was made in accordance to ACID principles to ensure reliable and secure transactions
                    <br>
                    It is also quite effective at data storing, retrival, and management and is quite scalable while maintaining high performance
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: gainsboro;">
                    <b>Airline Ticket System</b>
                    <p>An Airline Ticket System group project i was a part of while studying object oriented programming</p>
                    This was a PostgreSQL database connected to Java via JDBC to manage flights, users and thier tickets
                    <br>
                    It was made in accordance to SOLID principles and utilized design patterns such as singleton, builder and factory
                    <br>
                    Despite some limitations that could be fixed, it is an effective system
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: gainsboro;">
                    <b>Matrix Row Reduction Program</b>
                    <p>A program for solving systems of linear equations</p>
                    A C++ program made to help solving problems in linear algebra
                    <br>
                    It uses Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination to simplify the given matrix to its reduced row echelon form
                    <br>
                    It is capable of handling matrixes of different sizes of matrixes to be applicable in various problems
                    <br>
                    However i must note that it wasn't quite time effective, which was solved by using C++ instead of Java
